				<p>Poetry:</p>
				<pre>
                In the digital realm where we dwell,
                Where codes and scripts cast their spell,
                A language born of machines and men,
                Is the web programming that reigns again.
                
                With lines of text and symbols so fine,
                A page comes alive like a neon sign,
                Dynamic and responsive, it glows and shines,
                As users explore, and information aligns.
                
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in tow,
                These elements work in tandem to show,
                A web page that's sleek and oh-so-clean,
                An interface that's easily seen.
                
                From backend to frontend, they all play a role,
                With servers and databases that have a goal,
                To store and retrieve data with ease,
                Making web programming a skill to seize.
                
                It's a language of its own, a world so vast,
                With endless possibilities that forever last,
                So let the creativity flow and the passion ignite,
                As we build the web with all our might.

					CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is an amazing technology that has
					revolutionized the way we design and style websites. Here are a few
					reasons why CSS is awesome:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Separation of Content and Style: CSS allows web developers to
						separate the content of a website from its presentation. This means
						that you can create a website with clean HTML markup and then style
						it using CSS, which makes it easier to maintain and update the
						design of the site.
					</li>
					<li>
						Consistency and Reusability: CSS allows you to define styles once
						and apply them to multiple elements on a page or across multiple
						pages on a website. This promotes consistency in design and makes it
						easier to reuse styles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Responsive Design: With CSS, you can create websites that are
						responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This
						means that your website will look great on a desktop computer, a
						tablet, or a smartphone.
					</li>
					<li>
						Animation and Interactivity: CSS allows you to create animations and
						add interactivity to your website without the need for complex
						JavaScript code. This can make your website more engaging and fun to
						use.
					</li>
					<li>
						Flexibility and Customization: CSS offers a wide range of options
						for customizing the appearance of a website, from fonts and colors
						to layout and spacing. This flexibility allows you to create unique
						and visually appealing designs.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Overall, CSS is a powerful tool for web developers that offers a wide
					range of benefits and allows for endless creativity in website design.
