The algorithm addresses the problem of identifying optimal subgroups within a larger community.

The input consists of .gml files and the output comprises .txt files with the format "node: community" and a graph displayed using the matplotlib.pyplot library.

The graph distinguishes between different communities by color-coding and labeling each node with its ID.

Additionally, I have created six new .gml files containing undirected graphs with labeled information on:

- actors
- dog names
- French names
- musicians
- painters
- writers.
