# Problems

This repository contains a collection of algorithms that solve various problems. Each problem is implemented as a method in the `Problems` class.

## Problem 1: Last Alphabetically Word

Method: `theFirstProblem(String text)`

Description: Determines the last word, alphabetically, from a sentence.

## Problem 2: Euclidean Distance

Method: `theSecondProblem(Pair pair1, Pair pair2)`

Description: Finds the Euclidean distance between two points in a plane.

## Problem 3: Scalar Product of Sparse Vectors

Method: `theThirdProblem(double[][] list1, double[][] list2)`

Description: Calculates the scalar product of two sparse vectors.

## Problem 4: Unique Words in Text

Method: `theForthProblem(String text)`

Description: Finds words that appear only once in a text.

## Problem 5: Duplicate Number in an Array

Method: `theFifthProblem(int[] array)`

Description: Finds the number that appears twice in an array of integers.

## Problem 6: Majority Element in an Array

Method: `theSixthProblem(int[] array)`

Description: Determines the majority element in an array, which appears more than half of the number of elements.

## Problem 7: K-th Biggest Element

Method: `theSeventhProblem(int[] array, int k)`

Description: Finds the k-th element in the descending sorted array.

## Problem 8: Binary Numbers from 1 to n

Method: `theEighthProblem(int n)`

Description: Generates all binary numbers from 1 to n.

## Problem 9: Sums of Sub-Matrices

Method: `theNinthProblem(int[][] matrix, List<Pairs> pairs)`

Description: Calculates the sums of sub-matrices in a matrix based on given row and column pairs.

## Problem 10: Line with the Most 1s

Method: `theTenthProblem(int[][] matrix)`

Description: Finds the line in a matrix that contains the most occurrences of the number 1.
