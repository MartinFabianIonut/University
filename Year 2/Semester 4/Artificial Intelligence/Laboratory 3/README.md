The algorithm addresses the problem of identifying optimal subgroups within a larger community.

The input consists of .gml files and the output comprises .txt files with the format "node: community" and a graph displayed using the matplotlib.pyplot library.

The graph distinguishes between different communities by color-coding and labeling each node with its ID.

!!! In addition to implementing modularity, I've created two functions. The first function reinterprets modularity, while the second function applies to graphs that can be ideally divided into communities. This allows me to improve the fitness calculation based on that input.

The program is executed on two additional input sets that were provided to us, namely "lesmis.gml" and "netscience.gml". And, also, on the inputs I provided for the previous lab.
