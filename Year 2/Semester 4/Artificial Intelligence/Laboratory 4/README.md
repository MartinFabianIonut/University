# The fourth laboratory

The algorithm tackles the task of finding the shortest route that visits all nodes, starting from a specific node.

I conducted tests on the algorithm's performance on three difficulty levels, namely easy, medium, and hard.

To produce offspring, I utilized various functions for the crossover of chromosomes. Specifically, for the easy and medium tests, I applied the ordered crossover for permutations as outlined in the course. However, for the hard test, I modified the crossover to incorporate r random mutations of the genes. This was necessary because the ordered crossover would have been inefficient for the hard level.
