# The fifth laboratory

The homework implements routines to evaluate the performance of a ML algorithm for:

- prediction performance on a regression problem
- performance (accuracy, precision, recognition) on a classification problem

I have also solved the optional requirements concerning the loss functions and implemented the cross-entropy and multi-label cross-entropy functions.
