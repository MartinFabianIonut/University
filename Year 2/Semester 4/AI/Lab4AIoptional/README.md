# Lab 4 optional

I solved the optional requirement of finding the shortest path that starts from one node, visits all nodes and returns to the starting point using an ant-inspired algorithm (Ant Colony Optimization).

I created 2 classes: Ant and BestAntTour, which describe the optimisation method with the idea of finding the optimal path (tour) by following the pheromones left by ants.

I tested the implementation on two static and two dynamic datasets, adding the missing edges with high costs, in order to work with data modelling a complete graph so that every association of nodes is valid.
